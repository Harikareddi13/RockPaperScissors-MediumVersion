# 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors (Stage 2 – Score Tracking)

This is the **Stage 2** version of my Rock Paper Scissors project.  
Unlike Stage 1 (which only used alerts), this version **displays results directly on the page** and adds **score tracking with persistence**.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 **Interactive Gameplay** – Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
